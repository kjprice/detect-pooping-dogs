To start, simply run `./python/scan_for_dogs.py`

To do this in Visual studio, follow these steps (found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52705643/abort-trap-6-when-attempting-opencv-video-capture-on-macos-mojave)):
1. type cmd+shift+p
2. type "shell command: Install code in PATH"
3. Close vscode
4. Use "sudo code" to open vscode
5. It will give warning not to run as a root user
6. Ignore the warning and run the file , you will not get the "Abort trap: 6" error anymore.
